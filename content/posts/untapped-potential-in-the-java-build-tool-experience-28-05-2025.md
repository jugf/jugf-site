description: "Untapped Potential in the Java Build Tool Experience"
---

The Java language is known to be fast, safe, and easy, but Java build tools like Maven or Gradle sometimes don't quite live up to that standard. This talk will explore what "could be": where current Java build tools fall short in performance, extensibility, and ease of getting started. 

We will end with a demonstration of an experimental build tool _Mill_ that makes use of these ideas, proving out the idea that Java build tooling has the potential to be much faster and easier than it is today.

_Haoyi graduated from MIT, has built infrastructure for high-growth companies like Dropbox and Databricks, and has been a major contributor to the open source community with a focus on JVM developer tools. Haoyi has deep experience in the JVM and related technologies, and has used it professionally to build cloud infrastructure, distributed backend systems, programming languages, high-performance web applications, and much more._
