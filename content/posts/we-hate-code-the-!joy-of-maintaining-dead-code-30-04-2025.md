Do you love to maintain code that you didn’t wrote? Probably not...

As systems grow and evolve, the codebase inevitably accumulates clutter, including unused or "dead" code.  

Often the developers who wrote that code are not even in the company anymore. So how do you know if the code is still used? Dead code can be confusing and it can be the source for vulnerabilities in your code base.  

So it is not only "legacy" code we have to deal with but also "dead" code and even so called "zombie" code.

This session will give you an overview over the common struggle with this types of code and it will try to give you an idea about the differences between those types of code and about tools that will help you to get rid of it.
